Welcome to the Game Boy version of Atomas!

How to Play:

Press the (A) button to place the center atom into the circle.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the placement cursor.

If a plus atom is placed between two identical atoms, they will merge into the next higher element (chain reactions are possible).

When a minus atom appears in the center, you can absorb an atom from the circle by pressing (A).
After absorbing, press (B) to either convert the absorbed atom into a plus or insert it back into the circle with (A).

The game ends when the circle contains 12 atomsâ€”so plan carefully and try to reach the highest element possible before that happens!
